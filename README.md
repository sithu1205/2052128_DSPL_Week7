Overview
This project contains two mini data science workflows â€” a classification task for predicting diabetes and a clustering task for analyzing weather station distribution. The project follows a structured lifecycle from data loading to model evaluation.

 Tasks Covered
- Diabetes Classification (Tasks 1-13)
Load and explore patient data (diabetes.csv)
Data preprocessing and feature-target split
Train-test splitting with stratification
Model training using Decision Tree
Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall
Comparison with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Weather Station Clustering (Tasks 14-18)
Load air quality data (pm25_2016_2020.csv)
Extract latitude and longitude
Apply K-Means clustering to group stations into clusters
Visualize clusters on a scatter plot
